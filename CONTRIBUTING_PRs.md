## Quick start guide for experienced Github users (on a Linux host)

On Github

1. Get your own Github account

    a. Define a token (??name) to allow command line access from your local host to your Github account
    
    b. Assign the token in your local git resource file (??name)

2. Fork this repository to your account

On your local host:

1. Clone the repository to your local host as the origin
2. Set the remotes as "origin" for your own Github repo and "upstream" for the Raku/doc repo
3. Check out a new branch to make your changes
4. When ready to submit the PR, commit your changes with a good commit message
5. Push the new branch to your Github account

On your Github repo

1. Submit the PR
2. Await approval or further action or guidance from someone who has a commit bit
3. If no action is seen for a day, politely ping someone on the #raku IRC channel
