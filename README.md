at [https://docs.raku.org/](https://docs.raku.org/).

This is currently the recommended way to consume the documentation.

## Docker container

This documentation is also published as
the
[`jjmerelo/perl6-doc`](https://hub.docker.com/r/jjmerelo/perl6-doc) Docker
container. It includes a copy of the web published on port 3000, so you
can run it with:

    docker run --rm -it -p 3000:3000 jjmerelo/perl6-doc

or

    docker run --rm -it -p 31415:3000 jjmerelo/perl6-doc

in case you want it published somewhere else. You can direct your
browser to `http://localhost:3000` (or 31415, as the case may be).

## Help Wanted!

Raku is not a small language, and documenting it and maintaining that
documentation takes a lot of effort. Any help is appreciated.

Here are some ways to help us:

 * Add missing documentation for classes, roles, methods or operators.
 * Add usage examples to existing documentation.
 * Proofread and correct the documentation.
 * Tell us about missing documentation by opening issues on Github.
 * Do a `git grep TODO` in this repository, and replace the TODO items by
   actual documentation.

[Issues page](https://github.com/Raku/doc/issues) has a list of current issues and
documentation parts that are known to be missing
and [the CONTRIBUTING document](CONTRIBUTING.md)
explains briefly how to get started contributing documentation.

## Some notes:

**Q:** Why aren't you embedding the docs in the CORE sources?<br />
**A:** Several reasons:

  1. This documentation is intended to be universal with
     respect to a given version of the specification,
     and not necessarily tied to any specific Raku
     implementation.
  2. Implementations' handling of embedded Pod is still
     a bit uneven; this avoids potential runtime impacts.
  3. A separate repo in the Raku Github account invites
     more potential contributors and editors.

**Q:** Should I include methods from superclasses or roles?<br />
**A:** No. The HTML version already includes methods from superclasses and
       roles.

## Vision

> I want p6doc and docs.raku.org to become the No. 1 resource to consult
> when you want to know something about a Raku feature, be it from the
> language, or built-in types and routines. I want it to be useful to every
> Raku programmer.

# ENV VARS

- `P6_DOC_TEST_VERBOSE` to a true value to display verbose messages during test suite run.
Helpful when debugging failing test suite.
- `P6_DOC_TEST_FUDGE` fudges `skip-test` code examples as TODO in `xt/examples-compilation.t` test.
