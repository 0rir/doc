=TITLE Experimental features

=SUBTITLE Preview of upcoming new language features available for user evaluation

During Perl 6 development, new features are often made available for
users to experimental with before their design is completed. Eventually
these features may be made part of the Perl 6 specification.  To use these
features, one uses the C<experimental> pragma in program source code, for
example, like this:

    use experimental :macros;

Following is a list of current experimental features and a short
description of each feature's purpose or a link to more details about
its use.  (Note: Features marked "[TBD]" are to be defined
later.)

not yet rendered properly.
