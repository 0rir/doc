=TITLE Experimental features

=SUBTITLE Preview of upcoming new language features available for user evaluation

During Perl 6 development, new features are often made available for
users to experimental with before their design is completed. Eventually
these features may be made part of the Perl 6 specification.  To use these
features, one uses the C<experimental> pragma in program source code, for
example, like this:

    use experimental :macros;

Following is a list of current experimental features and a short
description of each feature's purpose or a link to more details about
its use.  (Note: Features marked "[TBD]" are to be defined
later.)

=comment The following should be a table but formatting in tables is
not yet rendered properly.

=item X<B<cache>|cache> [TBD]

=item X<B<pack>|pack> [TBD]

=head2 X<B<macros>|macros>

L<Macros|https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Macro_(computer_science)> are
code-generating routines, that generate code in compile time, before the program
is executed. In Perl 6 its use is still experimental and it needs to be turned
on via the pragma

    use experimental :macros;

In its simplest form, it simply returns a string, that will be fed into the compiler.
