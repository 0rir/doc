=TITLE Filename extensions

=SUBTITLE The extensions recommended for files with Raku content.

=begin table
File contents          | Extension | Historic extensions
========================================================
Raku script            | .raku     | .pl, .p6
Raku module            | .rakumod  | .pm, .pm6
Raku documentation     | .rakudoc  | .pm, pm6, pod, pod6
Test files in raku     | .rakutest | .t
Not Quite Perl (NQP)   | .nqp      |
=end table

Note that in most cases, the historic extensions will still work.

=head1 Introduction

A filename extension is defined, at least for this page, as the remaining letters after and including
the final '.'. A filename without a '.' in the filename does not have a filename extension.

Filename extensions can be used to associate behavior with the file content, such as opening
a specialized reader or editor, running a program with the file content as input, etc. On some
operating systems, this is almost the required behavior. Even when it is not required by the
operating system, filename extensions provide a useful mnemonic, or reminder, about the contents
of the file.

Early filesystems, the part of the operating system handling filenames, constrained filename extensions
to three characters after the '.'. This is no longer a constraint.

=head1 History and extensions

The Raku language was for many years known as PerlÂ 6, and filename extensions
were adopted accordingly. Consequently, there is a best current practice and a previous best
practice. The table at the top is an attempt to list all the filename extensions, starting with the
earliest on the left.

The most recent best practice is shown in the last column.

Some modules will become widely used, and will have filename extensions associated with them.

A module developer / maintainer may add to the table and create a PR with the change in the
same way as making other changes to the documentation.
