=TITLE Data structures

=SUBTITLE How PerlÂ 6 deals with data structures and what we can expect from them.

=head1 Scalar structures

Some classes do not have any I<internal> structure, and to access parts of them specific methods have to be used. Numbers, strings, and some other monolithic classes are included in that class. They use the C<$> sigil, although complex data structures can also use it.

    my $just-a-number = 7;
    my $just-a-string = "8";

There is a L<Scalar> class, which is used internally to assign a default value to variables declared with the C<$> sigil.
