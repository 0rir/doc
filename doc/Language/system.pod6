=head1 Getting arguments through the command line

The simplest way is to use the L<C<@*ARGS>|/language/variables#index-entry-%24%2AARGS> variable to obtain arguments from the command line; this array will contain the strings that follow the program name. L<C<%*ENV>|/language/variables#Runtime_Environment> will contain the environment variables, so that if you use:

=begin code :lang<shell>
export API_KEY=1967196417966160761fabc1511067
./consume_api.p6
=end code

You can use them from your program this way:

    my $api-key = %*ENV<API_KEY> // die "Need the API key";

This will fail if the environment variable C<API_KEY> has not been defined previously.

PerlÂ 6 has a better way to deal with command line arguments if they represent file names: the L<C<$*ARGFILES>/language/variables#index-entry-%24%2AARGFILES> dynamic variable.

=begin code
for $*ARGFILES.lines -> $l {
    say "Long lines in {$*ARGFILES.path}"
        if $l.chars > 72 ;
}
=end code

You can run this program this way C<argfiles.p6 *.p6>, for instance, and it will print a file name every time it finds a line longer than 72 characters. C<$*ARGFILES> contains filehandles of all files described in the command lines- C<.lines> will read in turn one line from every one of them, changing the value of C<$*ARGFILES.path> every time a new handle is being processed. In general, it provides a very convenient API for scripts that deal with sets of files.

=head1 Running programs synchronous and asynchronously

There are two routines to run external programs:

=head1 Making operating system calls through the native API
