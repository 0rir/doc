=TITLE role Associative

=SUBTITLE Object that supports looking up values by key

    role Associative[::TValue = Mu, ::TKey = Str(Any)] { }

A common role for types that support name-based lookup through
L«postcircumfix:<{ }>|/language/operators#postcircumfix_{_}», for example
L<Hash> and L<Map>. It is used for type checks in operators that expect to find
specific methods to call. See
L<Subscripts|/language/subscripts#Methods_to_implement_for_associative_subscripting>
for details.

The C<%> sigil restricts variables to objects that do C<Associative>.

=head1 Methods

=head2 of

Defined as:

    method of()

C<Associative> is actually a L<parametrized role|language/objects#Parameterized_Roles>
which can use different classes for keys and values. As seen above, by default
it coerces to C<Str> for the key and uses a very generic C<Mu> for value.

    my %any-hash;
    say %any-hash.of;#  OUTPUT: «(Mu)␤»

The value is the first parameter you use when instantiating C<Associative> with
particular classes:

    class DateHash is Hash does Associative[Cool,DateTime] {};
    my %date-hash := DateHash.new;
    say %date-hash.of; # OUTPUT: «(Cool)␤»

=head2 keyof

Defined as:

    method keyof()

Returns the parametrized key used for the Associative role, which is C<Any>
coerced to C<Str> by default. This is the class used as second parameter when
you use the parametrized version of Associative.

    my %any-hash;
    %any-hash.keyof; #OUTPUT: «(Str(Any))␤»
