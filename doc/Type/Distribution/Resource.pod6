=SUBTITLE Every one of the resources installed with a distribution

    class Distribution::Resource { }

A C<Distribution::Resource> is every one of the individual resources (files
or libraries) that are returned as values of the
L<C<%*RESOURCES>|/syntax/$PERCENT_SIGN%3FRESOURCES> dynamic variable (which,
itself, is an instance of C<Distribution::Resources>. These resources are
installed as part of the standard distribution installation process; please
check the definition of C<%*RESOURCES> above for more context.

Externally, every one of these resources behaves as an C<IO::Path>, and it
shares many of the same methods; however, it's really I<not> an C<IO::Path>
and thus cannot be smartmatched to it.
